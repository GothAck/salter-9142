Salter 9142 MiBody USB Data Converter

I purchased some scales because they had a USB interface...
The file format is disappointingly binary with a .TXT ending.

It seems Salter use different file formats for different scales,
which is also slightly annoying, but thanks to other people's documentation
I worked out this format.

I'll be making this into a library soon, it currently converts from bin to JSONstream.
